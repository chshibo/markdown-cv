## Technical Reports
`2019`
__Deep Dive Into the Cost of Context Switch__
- <u>Shibo Chen</u>, Yu Wu, Xinyun Jiang, Wen-Jye Hu
- *In this project, we are trying to identify the major components of the context swtich overhead on modern CPUs. We showed that data cache misses and d-TLB misses are two major contributors of the overhead. Furthermore, we showed that it requires a non-trivial effort to implement an user-level multithreading library.*

`2018`
__ThundaTag: Disparate Domain Tagging to Enforce Benign Program Behavior__
- Alex Kisil, <u>Shibo Chen</u>
- *In this project, we implemented and evaluated the architectural support for domain tagging. Our study shows that such design only requires negligible area overhead and induces low performance overhead.*  

`2018`
__An Alpha-64 Out-of-Order Processor Design__
- <u>Shibo Chen</u>, Zhen Feng, Chin-Wei Hsu, Yueying Li, Wenhao Peng
- *Our team implemented a three-way superscalar alpha-64 out-of-order CPU. We are able to achieve 100MHz and IPC of 0.94 with Synopsys 90nm generic library for education under the constraint area requirements.*

`2018`
__Understanding the Value of Ensemble of Moving Target Defenses in Morpheus__
- <u>Shibo Chen</u>
- *In this work, I studied the average time needed to penetrate a de-featured Morpheus design. The result underscores the robustness of Morpheus defenses.*

`2018`
__PowerSpy Upgraded: Location Tracking using Mobile Device Power Analysis__
- <u>Shibo Chen</u>, Shengtuo Hu
- *In this work, we extended the original Powerspy paper to more environments. Our study shows the availability of attacker using this attack to conduct indoor tracking.*
