## Technical Reports
`2019`
__Shadowclone: Thwarting and Detecting DOP Attacks with Stack Layout Randomization and Canary__
- Yunjie Pan, <u>Shibo Chen</u>, Cheng Chi, Yifan Guan
- *In this project, we developed a compile-time randomization technique to thwart Data-Oriented Programming attacks. Furthermore, we utilize stack canary to detect ongoing attacks. Our results show that our approach has low performance overhead on programs with few function calls. We also show that it is practically hard for attackers to succeed even under our conservative assumptions.*

__Deep Dive Into the Cost of Context Switch__
- <u>Shibo Chen</u>, Yu Wu, Xinyun Jiang, Wen-Jye Hu
- *In this project, we identified the major components of the context swtich overhead on modern CPUs. We show that data cache misses and d-TLB misses are two major contributors of the overhead. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it requires a non-trivial effort to implement an user-level multithreading library.*

`2018`
__ThundaTag: Disparate Domain Tagging to Enforce Benign Program Behavior__
- Alex Kisil, <u>Shibo Chen</u>
- *In this project, we implemented and evaluated the architectural support for domain tagging. Our study shows that such design only requires negligible area overhead and induces low performance overhead.*  

`2018`
__An Alpha-64 Out-of-Order Processor Design__
- <u>Shibo Chen</u>, Zhen Feng, Chin-Wei Hsu, Yueying Li, Wenhao Peng
- *Our team implemented a three-way superscalar alpha-64 out-of-order CPU. We are able to achieve 100MHz and IPC of 0.94 with Synopsys 90nm generic library for education under the constraint area requirements.*

`2018`
__Understanding the Value of Ensemble of Moving Target Defenses in Morpheus__
- <u>Shibo Chen</u>
- *In this work, we studied the average time needed to penetrate a de-featured Morpheus design. The result underscores the robustness of Morpheus defenses.*

`2018`
__PowerSpy Upgraded: Location Tracking using Mobile Device Power Analysis__
- <u>Shibo Chen</u>, Shengtuo Hu
- *In this work, we extended the original Powerspy paper to more environments. Our study shows the availability of attacker using this attack to conduct indoor tracking.*
